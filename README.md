# Smart Urban Air Quality Monitoring System

## Overview
This project implements an IoT-based Smart Urban Air Quality Monitoring System using the UCI Air Quality dataset. The system leverages machine learning to predict air quality levels and provides insights through a Tableau dashboard.

## Dataset
- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Air+Quality)
- **Description**: Contains 9,358 hourly records of air pollutants and environmental conditions collected between March 2004 and February 2005.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning, handling missing values, feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and statistical insights.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Time Series Prediction**: Linear Regression for future air quality trends.
  - **Deep Learning Model**: LSTM-based neural network for CO concentration prediction.
- **Visualization**: Plots for feature analysis, model performance, and predictions.
- **Dashboard**: Tableau Public dashboard for real-time air quality insights.


## Results
- **Time Series Model Performance**: Linear regression showed an RMSE of X.XX.
- **Deep Learning Model Performance**: LSTM achieved an RMSE of Y.YY.
